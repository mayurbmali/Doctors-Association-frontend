 a **focused spotlight effect** — where hovering on one card keeps it sharp and fades/blurs the surrounding cards. 
In Meet Our Founding Pillars section:

> A premium, modern **“Meet Our Founding Pillars”** section for a professional medical association website.
>
> The layout contains **four elegant profile cards** displayed in a row, each featuring a founding member with smooth interactive effects. 
>
> #### 🧩 **Card Interaction Logic**
>
> * **Default State:**
>
>   * All four cards show **professional portrait photos** with the member’s **name and title** overlaid at the bottom in a clean, modern sans-serif font (Poppins, Inter, or Open Sans).
>   * Example:
>     **Dr. Prakash Desai**
>     *Senior Homoeopathic Consultant, Mumbai*
> * **Hover State (Focus Effect):**
>
>   * When one card is hovered:
>
>     * The **hovered card remains in sharp focus**, bright and clear.
>     * The **other three cards softly blur and dim**, creating a **spotlight effect** on the active card.
>     * The hovered card slightly **lifts up** with a gentle shadow expansion for depth.
>     * A **semi-transparent dark overlay** appears on the active card, and a **testimonial paragraph** fades in smoothly.
>     * Example quote:
>       “Instrumental in advancing homoeopathic practice across Maharashtra. The networking and continuous education opportunities are unmatched.”
> * The paragraph text is **clear, well-spaced, and readable** — slightly larger font size (around 1.1rem) with high contrast against the overlay.
>
> #### 🎨 **Visual & Layout Design**
> 
> * **Card Style:** rounded corners, soft drop shadow, light gradient border animation on hover.
> * **Background:** warm **orange-to-golden gradient** to match brand palette.
> * **Typography:** clean sans-serif, white or off-white for text on hover, dark gray or navy for default names.
> * **Microinteractions:**
>
>   * Smooth transitions (0.4–0.6s ease).
>   * Soft shadow expansion on hover.
>   * Blurring animation for non-hovered cards (blur radius ~6–8px).
>   * Optional gradient border glow on hovered card edges.
>
> #### 🏷️ **Section Title**
>
> * Centered at the top in bold, refined text:
>   **Meet Our Founding Pillars**
> * Subtitle (optional): *Visionaries who shaped our foundation and continue to inspire our journey.*
>
> #### 💡 **Overall Feel**
>
> The section should look **elegant, professional, and interactive**, creating a sense of focus and admiration for each founding member.
> Smooth transitions and readability are key — users should feel a subtle cinematic shift as they hover between cards.
