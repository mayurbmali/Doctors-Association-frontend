  - Path alias: '@' points to 'src' directory

## Scripts

## Installation Notes
- Dependencies installed with `--legacy-peer-deps` flag due to date-fns version conflict with react-day-picker
- All packages installed and working correctly

## Known Issues & Fixes
- **styled-jsx syntax**: The Navbar component was using `<style jsx>` which caused React warnings. Fixed by removing the `jsx` attribute since styled-jsx is not configured in this project.
