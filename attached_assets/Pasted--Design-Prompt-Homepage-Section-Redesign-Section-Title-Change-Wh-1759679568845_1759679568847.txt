#### ✅ **Section Title:**

Change **"What Our Members Say"** to ** “Meet Our Founding Team” 

---

#### 🎯 **Core Layout Requirements:**

* Replace the slider with **4 static cards** (no carousel).
* Display **2 cards per row**, totaling 2 rows.
* Each card should prominently feature:

  * A **round image** (not too small, not too large – ideally 120px–160px diameter).
  * **Name** and **Designation** always visible.
  * A **small paragraph of description revealed on hover**.

---

#### 🎨 **Design & Aesthetics:**

* **Remove existing orange & green gradient background.**

  * Replace with a **cool, modern background** – suggestion: light neutral (e.g., soft white, off-white, or pastel gradient).
  * Alternatively, use a **glassmorphism** or **frosted card background** with subtle shadows.

---

#### 🖼️ **Card Details:**

* Cards should be **modern with rounded corners** and **subtle box shadows**.
* Card content:

  * **Profile Picture** (round, centered or slightly top-aligned).
  * **Name** (bold, center-aligned).
  * **Designation** (smaller, below the name).
  * **Hidden Description Paragraph**, revealed only on **image hover**.

    * On hover: **image blurs**, description fades in over it with slight delay (0.2s-0.3s).

---

#### ⚙️ **Microinteractions & Animations:**

* **Card hover effects:**

  * Subtle **border animation** (e.g., animated gradient border or glowing pulse).
  * **Smooth image blur** on hover (`filter: blur(3px); transition: 0.3s ease-in-out`).
  * Description text **fades and scales slightly** into view.
* Add **cursor pointer** and maybe slight **card scale-up on hover** (`transform: scale(1.03)`).
* Ensure responsiveness across all screen sizes (stack to one per row on mobile).

---

#### 📁 **Content (4 Cards):**

Use the same individuals from your previous testimonial section. Their names and designations can stay, but now each should have:

* A profile photo
* A short paragraph that reflects their role/contribution when hovered

Example:

```text
Dr. Rajesh Patil
Homoeopathic Consultant, Nagpur
> "An advocate for research-integrated classical homoeopathy, leading several knowledge initiatives."
```

---

#### 📌 Notes:

* Ensure **accessibility**: hover effects should also be **keyboard navigable** and content should meet contrast standards.
* Lazy-load images for performance.
* Consider using **GSAP** or **Framer Motion** for smoother animations if using React.
