>     “Instrumental in advancing homoeopathic practice across Maharashtra. The networking and continuous education opportunities are unmatched.”
> * **Microinteractions:**
>
>   * Soft **border glow animation** (gradient light running around the card edges).
>   * Subtle **card lift effect** (using shadow depth) on hover.
>   * Smooth **fade and slide transitions** (0.3–0.5s ease-in-out).
>
> ---
